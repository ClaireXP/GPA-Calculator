# GPA-Calculator
Calculates the respective semester GPAs, cumulative GPA, predicted cumulative GPA, and FYE GPA (if they're in FYE) of a student at Purdue University regardless of the standing and year. Based on the predicted or actual cumulative GPA the calculator also informs the student if they qualify for either the deans list, semester honors, or both.

NOTES: 
- The calculator takes three inputs per course: name, credit hours, and letter grade.
- Even if the user enters future courses and credits, the calculator will not include the courses until a respective grade is inputted.
- In regards to the FYE GPA portion, course names are not space sensitive, but must be all caps.
